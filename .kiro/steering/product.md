# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
MirrorLingo is a web application that learns a user's everyday English speaking style (their common phrases, cadence, and intents) and transforms it into correct, natural Spanish translations plus daily micro-practice through spaced repetition, drills, and quick coaching on recurring mistakes.
