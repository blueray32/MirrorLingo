# Core Validation Commands

This video walks through the core validation commands for code review and validation workflows.

## What's Included

- **[code-review.md](./code-review.md)** - Performs a high-level sweep of the codebase and generates a code review report. Run this after a PIV loop, after multiple PIV loops, or when entering a new codebase for the first time.

- **[code-review-fix.md](./code-review-fix.md)** - Addresses issues from a code review. Can accept either a file path to a code review report or a natural language description of issues to fix. Flexible command for tackling review findings.

- **[validate.md](./validate.md)** - Runs the entire validation pyramid outside of structured plan execution. Provides flexibility to validate on-demand rather than only during execute workflows.

These commands are also available in the [.agents/commands/validation](../../.agents/commands/validation) folder.
