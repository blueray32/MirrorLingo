# PIV Loops in Action

This video demonstrates going through two different PIV loops quickly, showing how fast implementation can be when you have all your planning in place and leverage the AI coding assistant effectively.

## What's Included

- **[prompts.md](./prompts.md)** - Complete prompt sequence for one PIV loop, from priming through execution

The prompts show the full workflow:
1. Prime the AI coding assistant
2. Check the PRD to determine what to build next
3. Chat with the AI to explore the approach
4. Vibe planning phase
5. Create the structured plan
6. Validate and iterate on the plan
7. Execute the structured plan

This is a concise demonstration using six prompts total. In practice, you'll typically have more prompts during vibe planning and plan iteration, but this shows the core flow of the PIV loop process.
