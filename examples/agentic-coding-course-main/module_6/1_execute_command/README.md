# Execute Command

This video walks through the execute command and how we leverage it alongside the planning command to implement code from structured plans.

## What's Included

- **[execute.md](./execute.md)** - The execute command that takes a structured plan and implements the code

This command is also available in the [.agents/commands/core_piv_loop](../../.agents/commands/core_piv_loop) folder. The execute command is a core part of the PIV loop workflow - after creating a structured plan, we use execute to systematically implement each task.
