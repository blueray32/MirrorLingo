## Module 9 - Dynamous Remote Agentic Coding System

Welcome to Module 9, where we dive into creating a custom Remote Agentic Coding System, which I truly believe is the future of software development.

This module unveils a completely custom, extensible system built specifically for this course, so you can move your powerful AI systems outside of your local IDE or terminal and integrate them into virtually any application where your work already happens (e.g., GitHub, Telegram, Slack) and use any AI coding assistant (Claude and Codex supported now, more coming soon).

Within this module I'll even show you how to leverage your evolved PIV Loop and system commands in a Git-native workflow engine. This system is designed to be the most customizable remote agent solution available!

### Remote Agentic Coding System Repository

The complete implementation of the Dynamous Remote Agentic Coding System is available in its dedicated repository:
