# AI Coding Assistant Instructions

When working with this codebase:

1. **Read existing code first** to understand patterns
2. **Match naming conventions** (verbose, prefixed fields like `product_id`)
3. **Use structured JSON logging** with contextual fields for all operations
4. **Add docstrings** (Google style backend, JSDoc frontend) with examples
5. **Include type hints everywhere** (Python and TypeScript)
6. **Write tests** mirroring source structure with verbose names
7. **Run linters** before completing (Ruff, Biome must pass)
8. **Include `fix_suggestion`** in all error logs
9. **Never sacrifice clarity** for brevity
10. **Log all operations** with context for debugging

This codebase is optimized for AI readability. Maintain these standards.
