# Core Principles

**VERBOSE NAMING IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Use intention-revealing names: `product_id`, `product_name` (not `id`, `name`)
- Choose clarity over brevity always

**AI-FRIENDLY LOGGING IS MANDATORY**
- Structured JSON to stdout/console with contextual fields
- Descriptive event names (snake_case: `filtering_products`, `validation_failed`)
- Include `fix_suggestion` in error logs

**TYPE SAFETY IS REQUIRED**
- Backend: Full Pydantic validation
- Frontend: TypeScript strict mode, no `any` without justification

**DOCUMENTATION EVERYWHERE**
- Backend: Google-style docstrings with examples
- Frontend: JSDoc for complex functions
