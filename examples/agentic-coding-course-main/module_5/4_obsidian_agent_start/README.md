# Building the Obsidian AI Agent

This video shows building the Obsidian AI Agent from scratch on top of the FastAPI template from the previous video.

## What's Included

All of the AI layer (context and commands) used during this build is included in this folder for reference:

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Global rules and project context for the AI coding assistant
- **[commands/](./commands/)** - Core slash commands for planning, executing, and committing (prime, execute, plan-template, commit)
- **[reference/](./reference/)** - On-demand context including the PRD, tool designs, VSA patterns, and tool-building guide

**Note:** These commands and reference documents are also available in the root [.agents/](../../.agents/) folder. They're duplicated here so you can see the specific commands and context referenced in this video.
