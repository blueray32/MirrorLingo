# Layer 1 Planning: PRD Creation

This video walks through the Layer 1 planning process for the Obsidian AI Agent project - researching the problem space, making architectural decisions, and documenting the MVP scope.

## Key Outputs

This planning session produces two critical Layer 1 assets:

- **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)** - Product requirements document defining the goals, scope, and technical approach for the Obsidian AI Agent MVP
- **[mvp-tool-designs.md](./mvp-tool-designs.md)** - Design specifications for the core Pydantic AI tools (note manager, folder manager, vault query)

## The Process

Layer 1 planning focuses on **research and technology selection** before writing any code:

1. **Research Phase** - Exploring options for building an AI agent that operates on Obsidian vaults
2. **Technology Decisions** - Selecting FastAPI, Pydantic AI, and the Obsidian Copilot plugin
3. **Architecture Design** - Defining the vertical slice architecture and tool design patterns
4. **Scope Definition** - Creating the PRD and tool designs that will guide implementation

The key insight: Invest time in understanding **what you're building and why** so you can effectively guide and course-correct your AI coding assistant during implementation.
