# Template Setup

This video walks through setting up the AI-optimized FastAPI starter template that we'll build the Obsidian AI Agent on top of.

## The Template

We use the [FastAPI Starter for AI Coding](https://github.com/dynamous-community/fastapi-starter-for-ai-coding) - a production-ready template with:
- Vertical slice architecture
- FastAPI + Pydantic AI integration
- Docker setup with PostgreSQL
- Logging, CORS, and configuration management

## Getting Started

The **[init-project.md](./init-project.md)** command provides step-by-step instructions to:
1. Clone and configure the template
2. Set up the local development environment
3. Validate that everything is running correctly

> This command is also in the `.agents/commands` folder.

This automation ensures a consistent starting point for building the Obsidian agent.
