# First PIV Loop

This video demonstrates going through the first PIV loop to build the base Pydantic AI agent for the Obsidian AI Agent project.

## No Content in This Folder

This folder is intentionally empty - the video is a demonstration of the PIV loop workflow in action. At this point, we have all of our context set up from the previous videos (Layer 1 planning, PRD, tool designs, global rules, and commands), and now we're putting it to use.

## Note on Folder Content

Going forward, not all module folders will contain extensive materials. Modules 3 and 4 had longer READMEs and more content because that's where we dove deep into the components of AI coding systems and set up our context layer. As we move into implementation demonstrations (like this PIV loop), folders will be lighter on materials and heavier on practical application.
