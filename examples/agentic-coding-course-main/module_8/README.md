## Module 8 - Agentic Coding in GitHub

Welcome to Module 8, where we introduce remote agentic coding by leveraging GitHub!

GitHub is not just a tool - it is the orchestration layer and control center for managing tasks, tracking changes, and assigning work to your AI coding agents. In this module, we'll get our AI coding assistants set up in GitHub, and we'll even get as far as kicking off a complete PIV Loop, simply by commenting on an Issue or Pull Request!

### GitHub Action Workflows

All of the GitHub Action workflows covered in this module are implemented in the Obsidian AI Agent repository:
