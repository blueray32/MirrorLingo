# Exercise: Build Commands with Output Patterns

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes
**Purpose**: Apply command patterns by building a context loading command and a document creation command optimized for their consumers

---

## Overview

You'll build two commands demonstrating the core patterns from Video 2:

1. **Exercise 1: Priming Command** (Pattern 1: Context Loading)
   - Load tool development patterns into agent context
   - Output optimized for YOU (human-readable summary)

2. **Exercise 2: Planning Command Output** (Pattern 2: Document Creation)
   - Design structured output for feature planning
   - Output optimized for ANOTHER AGENT (structured, explicit)

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- [ ] Completed Videos 0-2 of Module 4
- [ ] Completed Module 3 (Global Rules) exercises
- [ ] Have the `adding_tools_guide.md` file from Module 3
- [ ] Understand Input → Process → Output framework
- [ ] Understand the three output patterns

---

## Exercise Structure

### Exercise 1: Build a Priming Command (15-20 min)
**Pattern**: Context Loading
**File**: `EXERCISE_1.md`

Build a command that loads tool development patterns into the agent's context at session start.

### Exercise 2: Design Planning Command Output (15-20 min)
**Pattern**: Document Creation
**File**: `EXERCISE_2.md`

Design the output structure for a planning command that creates documents for another agent to execute.

## What You'll Learn

By completing these exercises, you'll:
- Apply Pattern 1 (Context Loading) to build priming commands
- Apply Pattern 2 (Document Creation) to design agent-readable outputs
- Think about output optimization for different consumers
- Understand how commands chain in workflows
- Practice the Input → Process → Output framework

---

## Success Criteria

You've successfully completed the exercises if you:

**Exercise 1:**
- [ ] Created a working priming command
- [ ] Command loads tool patterns into context
- [ ] Output is human-readable and easy to scan
- [ ] Agent can explain the patterns back to you

**Exercise 2:**
- [ ] Designed a complete output structure
- [ ] Structure is explicit enough for another agent
- [ ] Includes all necessary sections for implementation
- [ ] Follows agent-to-agent communication principles

---

## Getting Started

1. Read EXERCISE_1.md and build your priming command
2. Test it and verify the output
3. Read EXERCISE_2.md and design your planning output structure
4. Compare with the solution guide when done
