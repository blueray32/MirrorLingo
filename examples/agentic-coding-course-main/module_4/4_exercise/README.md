# Exercise: Build Commands with Output Patterns

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes

**Purpose**: Apply command patterns by building a context loading command and a document creation command optimized for your use case(s)

## Overview

You'll build two commands demonstrating the core patterns from the last video:

1. **Exercise 1: Priming Command** (Pattern 1: Context Loading)
   - Load tool development patterns into agent context
   - Output optimized for YOU (human-readable summary so you can validate understanding)

2. **Exercise 2: Planning Command Output** (Pattern 2: Document Creation)
   - Design structured output for feature planning
   - Output optimized for ANOTHER AGENT (structured, explicit)

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- [ ] Completed Module 3 and Module 4 to this point
- [ ] Have the `adding_tools_guide.md` file from the Module 3 exercise solution
- [ ] Understand Input → Process → Output framework

## Exercise Structure

### Exercise 1: Build a Priming Command (15-20 min)

**Pattern**: Context Loading

**Instructions**: `exercise_1/EXERCISE_1.md`

**Reference File**: `exercise_1/adding_tools_guide.md`

**Solution**: `exercise_1/EXERCISE_1_SOLUTION.md`

Build a command that loads tool development patterns into the agent's context at session start.

### Exercise 2: Design Planning Command Output (15-20 min)

**Pattern**: Document Creation

**Instructions**: `exercise_2/EXERCISE_2.md`

**Reference File**: `exercise_2/PlanningPrompts.md`

**Solution**: `exercise_2/EXERCISE_2_SOLUTION.md`

Design the output structure for a planning command that creates documents for another agent to execute.

## What You Get Out of This

By completing these exercises, you'll:
- Apply Pattern 1 (Context Loading) to build priming commands
- Apply Pattern 2 (Document Creation) to design agent-readable outputs
- Think about output optimization for different consumers
- Understand how commands chain in workflows
- Practice the Input → Process → Output framework

---

## Getting Started

1. Read `exercise_1/EXERCISE_1.md` and build your priming command
2. Test it and verify the output
3. Read `exercise_2/EXERCISE_2.md` and design your planning output structure
4. Compare with the solution guides when done:
   - `exercise_1/EXERCISE_1_SOLUTION.md`
   - `exercise_2/EXERCISE_2_SOLUTION.md`

Let's build! 🚀
